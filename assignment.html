       <h2>Paper Proposal Digital Detectives</h2>

        <p>I would find it interesting for my final assignment to take a look at a film noir film script in comparison to a detective novel.<br>
          If they are both analysed the same way using digital tools, do similar results come out of it? <br>
          Which media to use is still a question for me. During the course we have been working with novels, <br>
          but could our tools work with film scripts too? <br>
          If so, then a comparison between film scripts would interest me most, <br>
          but when this will not the case, then a comparison between novels would be an excellent second option. <br>
          It might be easier to compare for example a Sherlock Holmes novel and its film adaptation, <br>
          but I think it would be more productive to look at a film noir film because of its different genre conventions, <br>
          that to my knowledge have not yet been analysed with digital tools. <br>
          In this assignment, could some differences be found between the detective genre and the film noir genre <br>
          when analysed under a digital macroscope?<br>
          A classic case of noir fiction that has been adapted to the screen is the film Strangers on a Train (1951) from Alfred Hitchcock.<br>
          This would be a perfect case of the noir genre, but which detective story to put next to it is still quite hard for me. <br>
          What are the conditions for a good comparison? Similarities between characters, or between the plot? <br>
          These are still things I would have to think about, <br>
          but I do believe that this kind of research within the Digital Humanities can throw new light on the dynamics <br>
          between the detective and the noir genre, and how the differences between them manifest themselves in different mediums. <br>
