        <p>I would find it interesting for my final assignment to take a look at a film noir film script in comparison to a detective novel.
          If they are both analysed the same way using digital tools, do similar results come out of it? 
          Which media to use is still a question for me. During the course we have been working with novels, 
          but could our tools work with film scripts too? 
          If so, then a comparison between film scripts would interest me most, 
          but when this will not the case, then a comparison between novels would be an excellent second option. <br>
          It might be easier to compare for example a Sherlock Holmes novel and its film adaptation, 
          but I think it would be more productive to look at a film noir film because of its different genre conventions, 
          that to my knowledge have not yet been analysed with digital tools. 
          In this assignment, could some differences be found between the detective genre and the film noir genre 
          when analysed under a digital macroscope?<br>
          A classic case of noir fiction that has been adapted to the screen is the film Strangers on a Train (1951) from Alfred Hitchcock.
          This would be a perfect case of the noir genre, but which detective story to put next to it is still quite hard for me. 
          What are the conditions for a good comparison? Similarities between characters, or between the plot? <br>
          These are still things I would have to think about, 
          but I do believe that this kind of research within the Digital Humanities can throw new light on the dynamics 
          between the detective and the noir genre, and how the differences between them manifest themselves in different mediums.
